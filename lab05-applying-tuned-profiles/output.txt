=== Tuned Troubleshooting Diagnostics ===
Date: Tue Feb 25 13:53:21 UTC 2026

1. Checking tuned service status:
● tuned.service - Dynamic System Tuning Daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/tuned.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2026-02-25 13:22:10 UTC; 31min ago
   Main PID: 1214 (tuned)

2. Checking if tuned daemon is running:
root      1214  0.1  0.5  93632 22112 ?        Ssl  13:22   0:01 /usr/bin/python3 -Es /usr/sbin/tuned -l -P

3. Current active profile:
Current active profile: balanced

4. Profile verification:
Verification succeeded, current profile 'balanced' was applied without errors.

5. Available profiles:
Available profiles:
- balanced                    - General non-specialized tuned profile
- throughput-performance      - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance
- virtual-guest               - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest
- virtual-host                - Optimize for running KVM guests
...
Current active profile: balanced

6. System recommendation:
virtual-guest

7. Checking for profile conflicts:
Active profile file exists: balanced

8. Checking tuned logs:
Recent tuned log entries:
Feb 25 13:51:08 ip-172-31-10-233 tuned[1214]: profiles: applied profile balanced
Feb 25 13:44:05 ip-172-31-10-233 tuned[1214]: profiles: applied profile custom-lab-profile

Feb 25 13:22:11 ip-172-31-10-233 tuned[1214]: profiles: applied profile virtual-guest

9. Checking for custom profiles:
Custom profiles found:

=== Tuned Best Practices Checklist ===

1. Tuned service should be enabled and running:
✓ Tuned service is enabled and running

2. Active profile should be verified:
✓ Active profile is properly applied

3. Profile should match system type:
 Current: virtual-guest
 Recommended: virtual-guest
✓ Using recommended profile

4. Custom profiles should be properly configured:
 Found 1 custom profile(s)
✓ custom-lab-profile has valid configuration

5. Performance monitoring recommendations:
 - Regularly monitor system performance after profile changes
 - Use tools like htop, iostat, vmstat for ongoing monitoring
 - Document performance baselines for comparison
 - Test profile changes in non-production environments first
